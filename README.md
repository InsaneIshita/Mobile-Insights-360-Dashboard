# Mobile Insights 360: Analyzing Usage & Behavior

## Overview
**Mobile Insights 360** is an Excel-based data analytics dashboard aimed at understanding mobile device usage patterns across different age groups, operating systems, and user behavior classes. This project analyzes key metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and daily data consumption, providing valuable insights into how people interact with their mobile devices.

## Project Objectives:
- Analyze mobile device usage across different user demographics.
- Understand the impact of device models and operating systems on battery consumption and data usage.
- Create actionable insights based on user behavior classification.

## Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset), providing 700 samples of mobile device usage data.

## Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
- **Data Visualization**: Various charts such as bar charts, scatter plots, and more.

## Key Insights:
1. **Battery Drain Impact**: The **iPhone 12** has the highest daily battery drain (~1590 mAh) among both iOS and Android devices.
2. **Most Active Age Group**: **Middle-aged adults (40-59)** have the highest average screen time at **5.3 hours/day**.
